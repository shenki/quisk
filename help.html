QUISK Help (November 2013)
</h3>

<p>
The <a href="docs.html">The documentation is here</a>.
<br>
</p>

<p>This is the Help file for Quisk, a Software Defined Radio (SDR).
This
Help appears
in Quisk when you press the Help button. Quisk is written by Jim
Ahlstrom, N2ADR,
www.james.ahlstrom.name. Mail to jahlstr at gmail.com. Quisk
has been
greatly improved and extended by Leigh L. Klotz Jr. WA5ZNU,
and by Andrew Nilsson VK6JBL.
Thanks to Terry Fox WB4JFI for code improvements, and for adding
support
for the Charleston hardware.
Thanks to Sid Boyce, G3VBV, for sending me SoftRock hardware to work
with.&nbsp; Thanks to Christof, DJ4CM, for many improvements to the GUI
and for Dx cluster display.
Thanks to Philip G. Lee for adding native support for pulseaudio.
<br>
</p>

<h3 id="g0.0.1">What Quisk Can Do </h3>

<p>
Depending on how you have configured it, Quisk can be used as a
radio receiver, a transceiver, or a panadapter. When you use Quisk as a
receiver or panadapter, you supply an antenna, a complex (I/Q) mixer to
convert radio spectrum to a low IF, and send
that IF to the left and right inputs of the sound card in your
computer.
The Quisk software will read the sound card data, tune it, filter it,
demodulate it, and send the audio to the same sound card for output to
external headphones or speakers. For most efficient use, you may wish
to configure some form of rig control in the your configuration file
and hardware file.
</p>

<p>
Quisk can also accept I/Q data from the SDR-IQ from RfSpace. The
selection
of SDR-IQ or soundcard is made in your configuration file.
</p>

<p>
Quisk rhymes with "brisk", and is QSK plus a few letters to make it
easier to pronounce. QSK is a Q signal meaning full break in CW
operation,
and Quisk has been designed for low latency. Quisk includes an input
keying signal that can mute the audio and substitute a side tone.
To install and configure Quisk, please see the docs.html file in the
Quisk directory.
<br>
</p>

<p>
Quisk is designed for QSK CW operation. It is written in Python, an
easy
to learn but powerful language; see www.python.org. Source is provided
because your own hardware is probably different from mine, and you will
need to change something. Changing Python is easy.
</p>

<p>
There are lots of other SDR projects; see the list at
http://f4dan.free.fr/sdr_eng.html.
I particularly recommend Linrad by SM5BSZ, PowerSDR, and SDRadio by
I2PHD. Reading
the
Linrad pages is a great introduction to SDR.
</p>

<h3 id="g0.0.2">Configuration File </h3>

Quisk first imports all its configuration information from the file
quisk_conf_defaults.py. Then it reads your configuration file.&nbsp; To
change your configuration, do
NOT change quisk_conf_defaults.py, because installing the next version
will cause your changes to be lost. Instead copy one of the
sample quisk_conf_*.py to your config file. For a standard
soundcard, copy quisk_conf_model.py. Make any changes you want to
your config file. To see what kinds of changes are
available, read the file quisk_conf_defaults.py. Please do NOT copy
quisk_conf_defaults.py to your config file. Your config file should
consist of only the lines that are different from
quisk_conf_defaults.py,
and it should be a small file.
<p>The configuration file also imports your hardware control file. This
is
quisk_hardware_model by default. To use a different
hardware file add "import quisk_hardware_fixed as quisk_hardware" (for
SoftRock, or another quisk_hardware_* file) to your configuration
file. You can control your own hardware either by writing a custom
hardware file, or by defining a "class Hardware" in your config file.
See docs.html for details, and read the various hardware files.
</p>

<p>
If you need to add custom controls to Quisk, add "import
quisk_widgets_mywidgets as quisk_widgets" to your configuration file,
and see quisk_widgets_n2adr.py. This is an advanced feature, and
you will need to understand wxPython.
</p>

<h3 id="g0.0.3">Testing QUISK </h3>

<p>
Look at the bottom row of buttons to the right. I guess you found the
Help
button, since this is the help screen. Press the Config (configuration)
button,
have a look, and then return to Help. If sound is running you should
see the
Interrupts count increasing steadily. Some sound card information is
shown,
and some error counts. If anything prints in red, something is wrong.
You must edit the configuration file to change the soundcard name or
rate.
There will be different sound card parameters for each name. See
docs.html for more information, or if you
can't
get sound to run. If Interrupts are increasing, the Graph and Waterfall
screen
should work too.
</p>

<p>
Next press Graph to look at the graph screen, and then Help to return.
You may need to run the "Ys" (Y scale) slide control on the right up or
down
to see the graph line. You should see a noise trace that changes
randomly (without sound input). Then press Test1. This generates a test
signal at 10 kHz, and you should see the spike on the graph. To tune
to that signal, click the mouse on the graph near the spike. Hold the
mouse button down and drag the red tuning line back and forth across
the test signal. You should head a pure audio tone in your speakers.
Use the "Vol" (Volume) slider on the left to change the volume.
<br>
</p>

<p>If you press Graph again, you will activate the peak hold functions
labeled "GraphP1" and "GraphP2".&nbsp; These will cause the graph to
follow the peak signal, and decay back down at a slow rate.&nbsp; To
control the rate, use the graph_peak_hold item in the config file.
<br>
</p>

<p>
Next press WFall to see the Waterfall screen, then Help to return.
You can resize the Quisk window to get see more waterfall history.
You will need to adjust "Ys" (Y scale) and "Yz" (Y zero) to get a
colored
display. You should see a strong 10 kHz signal. Press Test1 to turn
the signal on and off. Watch it appear and disappear from the
waterfall.
</p>

<p>
The top of the waterfall shows a small graph screen. You can grab the
bar between the screens with your mouse and move it up and down to
adjust
the relative sizes.
To adjust the scale and zero of this graph, hold down the Shift key
while
using the "Ys" and "Yz" sliders.
</p>

<p>
Next press Scope to see an oscilloscope screen. This is mainly useful
for debugging.
</p>

<p>
Last press Filter and wait a few seconds. The response of the current
filter is shown. Try changing filters by using the middle row of
buttons on the right.
</p>

<h3 id="g0.0.4">Tuning </h3>

<p>
On the Graph or Waterfall screens, you tune in a CW signal by clicking
above the X axis directly
on the signal. You tune in an SSB signal by clicking on the upper edge
(lower sideband) or the lower edge (upper sideband). That is, you
always click
where the carrier goes. Make sure the proper mode is selected with the
first row of buttons on the right. You can also click, hold down the
mouse button and drag the tuning line. The speed of tuning is lowest
close to the X axis, and increases as you move up. Try it.
</p>

<p>
If you click below the X axis, tuning will not jump to that frequency,
but
you can still hold the button and drag. That is useful for small
adjustments.
The mouse wheel will move the frequency up and down and round the
frequency to multiples of 50 Hertz.
</p>

<p>
If you right-click a signal, Quisk tunes to the signal as before, and
also
changes the VFO (if that is possible with your hardware) to move the
signal to
the center of the screen.
</p>

<p>
You can type a frequency into the entry box to the right of
the frequency display, and hit Enter to jump to it. The
frequency is in Hertz unless it has a decimal point, and then it
is megahertz.&nbsp;
The band Up and Down buttons do not
change the tuning, but will move the display up and down the band.
Hold these buttons down to keep moving.</p>

<p>You can left-click the digits in the frequency display to increase
(click the top) or decrease (click the bottom) the digit and round the
frequency.&nbsp; Try it.
<br>
</p>

<p>
To really perform tuning, you need a VFO controlled by Quisk. I use a
DDS
VFO controlled by Ethernet. This DDS has a transmit and receive
frequency,
and a key signal to choose which to generate. Quisk (currently) assumes
a single conversion to audio, as in the SoftRock-40 and FlexRadio 1000
receivers. If you have a fixed (crystal controlled) first conversion,
use quisk_hardware_fixed.py and change self.vfo to the frequency in
Hertz.
</p>

<p>
The frequency shown by the red tuning line and the frequency display
window
is always the transmit frequency.&nbsp; This equals the receive
frequency unless Split is used (see below).&nbsp; The frequency display
window will
turn red to indicate sound capture (input ADC) overrun (clipping).
<br>
</p>

The RIT (receiver incremental tuning) button and slider can add a small
offset to the receive frequency.&nbsp;&nbsp; Leave RIT off for SSB
unless
a station is off frequency a bit; then use RIT to tune him in while
leaving
your transmit frequency unchanged.&nbsp; When you select CW, the RIT
must be turned on to provide an audio output, so Quisk automatically
turns on RIT and sets it
to plus or minus cwTone.&nbsp; The audio side tone (if a hardware key
line is used) is set to the same.&nbsp; Just click CWL or CWU, tune the
frequency
by clicking exactly on the signal, and everything will work. The value
of
cwTone can be changed in your configuration file.
<p>If the Split button is pressed, a second green tuning line is shown
to indicate the receive frequency, and the receive frequency can be
independently adjusted.&nbsp; The mouse controls the closest tuning
line.&nbsp; To receive on the transmit frequency again, just turn Split
off.&nbsp; The Split feature is used to work a DX station operating
split, or it can be used to easily switch between two arbitrary receive
frequencies.</p>

<h3 id="g0.0.5">Top Row </h3>

The top row contains the frequency display, a window to enter a
frequency, two buttons to move up and down the band, three memory
buttons, two favorite buttons, the RIT control and the window for the
S-meter or frequency measurement display.
<br>

<br>

Quisk can remember and return to stations.&nbsp; When you have tuned in
a signal of interest, press the "Save" button Ⓜ↑ to save the frequency,
band and mode.&nbsp; Repeat for more
signals.&nbsp; Now press "Next" Ⓜ ➲,
to switch to the next saved signal, and press "Next" repeatedly to
cycle through the list.&nbsp; To delete a saved signal, first tune to
it with "Next" and then press "Delete" Ⓜ ☓ . If you save a large
number of signals, right click the "Next" button Ⓜ ➲, and you will get
a
popup menu so you can jump directly to a station.&nbsp; The saved
stations will appear in the station window below the frequency X axis.
<br>

<br>

Quisk can save a list of favorite stations.&nbsp; Press
Config/Favorites to access the screen, and right-click the left label
to insert and delete stations, and to tune to them.&nbsp; The two
favorites buttons provide direct access to this screen.&nbsp; The
★ ↑ button enters the current station into the screen; just
provide a name.&nbsp; The ★ ↓ button jumps to the screen;
right click the left label and choose "Tune to".&nbsp; Favorite
stations will appear in the station window with a Star symbol ★ .
<br>

<br>

The S-meter displays the signal strength in S units and in dB. Zero dB
is
clipping, the same as on the graph screen. The S-meter uses the
specified
filter bandwidth to choose the exact number of FFT bins to square and
average.
That is, it displays true RMS based on the FFT bins, not on the
post-filter audio. Note
that for a noise floor on the graph of -110 dB the S-meter will read
-93 dB (depending
on some details). That is
because the bandwith specified is much greater than the FFT bin width,
and more
noise is getting through. Find a flat noise frequency, change the
filter bandwidth,
and watch your S-meter measure the noise. The conversion from S-units
to dB depends
on your hardware. There are 6 dB per S-unit, and you can change
self.correct_smeter
in your configuration file (in S-units) to adjust to 50 microvolts for
S9. If the correction depends on the band, you can make a
band-dependent
correction in your hardware file.&nbsp; See below to change the S-meter
to a frequency measurement window.
<br>

<h3 id="g0.0.6">Station Window and Dx Cluster </h3>



There is a station window below the frequency axis (X axis) to display
stations of interest.&nbsp; This feature was added by Christof,
DJ4CM.&nbsp; It consists of zero or more lines containing an M-Circle
symbol Ⓜ for memory stations, a Star symbol ★ for
favorite stations and a Dx symbol for Dx Cluster stations (see
below).&nbsp; You control this feature by adding lines to your config
file; read the file quisk_conf_defaults.py (as usual) to see what lines
to add.&nbsp; The default number of lines is one, but you can add more
lines if the display becomes too crowded.&nbsp; If you move your mouse
near the marked frequency, a popup window will appear with station
details.&nbsp; Left-click the symbol to tune to it.
<br>

<br>

There are Dx Cluster telnet servers available that provide real time
information on Dx station activity.&nbsp; Set dxClHost to an available
server in your config file, add your call sign and check the
port.&nbsp; This feature will run continuously unless dxClHost is the
null string.&nbsp; The Dx stations will appear in the station window as
they become avaliable from the server.
<br>

<h3 id="g0.0.7">Screen Sliders</h3>

There are three sliders on the right of the Quisk screen.&nbsp; The
first two are labeled Ys and Yz, and they control the scale and zero of
the screen in view.&nbsp; For the Graph screen and the Rx Filter screen
they control the scale and zero of the Y axis.&nbsp; For the Waterfall
screen they control the Waterfall color scale; and if the Shift key is
down, they control the upper graph Y axis.&nbsp; For the Scope screen
the Ys slider controls the Y axis scale, and the Yz slider does
nothing.&nbsp; The sliders have no effect on other screens.
<br>

<br>

The Zo (zoom) slider expands the frequency scale (X axis) of the Graph
and Waterfall screens so that narrow signals can be examined.&nbsp;
Quisk operates normally when this slider is all the way down.&nbsp; As
it is raised, the frequency is expanded around the tuning
frequency.&nbsp; That is, the tuning frequency is moved to the center,
and the frequency scale is expanded.&nbsp; It is still possible to tune
Quisk as usual while this control is in use.&nbsp; For small frequency
shifts, remember to use the right mouse button.
<br>

<br>

<h3 id="g0.0.8">Other Controls </h3>

<p>
The sliders on the left control the main volume (Vol) and side tone
volume (STo).
Side tone is only active if you configure Quisk to operate as a
transceiver,
and change is_key_down.c to provide a key signal.
</p>

<p>
The first row of buttons on the left selects the band.
The "Audio" band is meant to set the VFO frequency to zero for use
with a sound card and no hardware control.
The "Time" band selects standard time signals. Pressing this button
repeatedly selects different frequencies. The remaining buttons select
the amateur bands. The 60 meter button can be pressed repeatedly
to select the channels. Adding bands requires
more band plans in your configuration file.</p>
<p>The second row of buttons on the left has the controls for audio
mute, AGC or Squelch, noise blanker and the automatic notch
filter.&nbsp; If your hardware supports it, there are controls for
preamplifier gain and antenna selection.&nbsp; The third row has the
controls for spot tuning, split Rx/Tx operation, full duplex, push to
talk, VOX and sound record and playback.</p>
<p>The AGC button can be right-clicked to pop up an adjustment
slider.&nbsp; There are separate settings for AGC off or on.&nbsp; The
settings control how much gain variation is allowed.&nbsp; When the
slider is at maximum (all the way up), all signals, even band noise,
will have the same maximum amplitude.&nbsp; For lower settings, loud
signals will have the maximum amplitude, but weaker signals will have
less amplitude.&nbsp; A medium setting allows you to hear the relative
amplitude of signals and any QSB while still protecting your
ears.&nbsp; I set the AGC On setting to a high value, and the AGC Off
setting to a lower value that allows band noise to be faintly heard.</p>
<p>When you switch the mode to FM, the AGC button changes to a squelch button.&nbsp; Right click it to adjust the squelch level.</p>
<p>When the Spot button is pressed, a carrier replaces the SSB
signal.&nbsp; This is used for tuning.&nbsp; Right click the Spot
button to adjust the level.
<br>

</p>




<p>
The first row of buttons on the right selects the receive mode.
The next row selects the filter to use. The filter bandwidths can be
set in your config file.&nbsp; The right-most filter button bandwidth
is adjustable; right-click it to adjust.&nbsp; The third row selects
the
screen to display: Graph, Waterfall, Scope, Config, Filter, or Help.
</p>

<p>
If you use the sound card for input, you may need to correct for small
errors
in the I and Q amplitude and phase. First change to the correct band,
because
corrections are saved for each band. Press the button on the config
screen to bring up a correction screen. Then feed a test signal to your
hardware
(or use a strong available signal) and look at the signal image. Adjust
the
slider controls to reduce the image. The upper slider is the fine
adjustment,
and the lower is the coarse. You will need to adjust both amplitude and
phase
and they will interact.&nbsp; The amount of available adjustment range
is controlled by your config file.&nbsp;
When
you have a final correction, it is a good idea to write it down.&nbsp;
The correction point is saved based on the VFO frequency, and you will
probably need two or three correction points per band.</p>

<h3 id="g0.0.9">Configuration Button </h3>
The Config button takes you to a number of screens that display status,
and provide for limited control of Quisk parameters.&nbsp; The
Favorites screen allows you to enter frequencies and modes for
stations, nets, etc.&nbsp; To add a line, right-click the left label
and select Insert or Append.&nbsp; To tune to a station, select
Tune.&nbsp; The Tx Audio screen controls the transmit audio, and
enables you to record and play it back.
<br>
<h3 id="g0.0.10">Transmit Audio </h3>
Quisk is a transceiver, and can provide a transmit signal if your
hardware has that capability.&nbsp; The PTT button is active if your
hardware file has the OnButtonPTT() method.&nbsp; Then you can use PTT
or VOX for audio modes.&nbsp; Transmit audio settings are on the Config
screen in the "Tx Audio" tab.
<br>

<br>
Quisk can provide sophisticated audio processing, but such processing
will increase noise and background levels unless you start with a clean
audio source.&nbsp; You can plug in a USB mic or headset as a
source.&nbsp; Or you can connect an analog mic to the mic input of your
sound card.&nbsp; Or you can connect your mic to a preamp, and then to
the line input of your sound card.&nbsp; The mic should be directly in
front of your mouth when you speak.&nbsp; Try to avoid headsets that
cause you to speak across the mic.&nbsp; The idea is to make your voice
as loud as possible relative to the background noise in your shack.
<br>

<br>
You need to adjust the mic sound level as high as possible, but without
too much clipping.&nbsp; The peak mic sound level is on the config
screens.&nbsp; Speak normally and try to get a level a few dB below
zero (clipping).&nbsp; The peak level should be at least -20 dB, and
preferably above -10 dB.&nbsp; Infrequent clipping (above 0 dB) is OK,
because Quisk will clip the audio anyway when it processes it.&nbsp; It
may be difficult to figure out how to adjust the mic level.&nbsp; For
Linux, figure out the correct control number, and use mixer_settings[];
or use one of the Linux mixer apps.&nbsp; For Windows, use the level
control on the audio control screen in Control Panel, but be careful
that another application does not change it after you set it for
Quisk.&nbsp; Quisk will attempt to adjust the audio level with its AGC,
but it helps to start with a good level.
<br>

<br>
Refer to the "Tx Audio" tab.&nbsp; Clip is the amount of audio clipping
from zero to 20 dB.&nbsp; There is actually some clipping at zero dB
due to the mic AGC.&nbsp; Preemphasis boosts the high frequencies in
your voice.&nbsp; Zero is no boost, and 1.0 is 6 dB per octave.&nbsp;
Use the record and playback buttons to test for the best control
settings.&nbsp; Notice that your voice will become louder with more
clipping.&nbsp; Note that SSB, AM and FM each have their own settings,
so change to the correct mode before you start.&nbsp; Audio processing
is most useful for SSB, so if you are a DX enthusiast, use aggressive
settings.&nbsp; I only use AM for rag chewing, so I use zero
preemphasis and 4 dB clipping.&nbsp; For FM, I use zero clipping and
preemphasis.
<br>

<h3 id="g0.0.11">Digital Modes DGT-* </h3>

<p>
These modes are for digital signals, and require an&nbsp; external
program such as Fldigi to decode the signals.&nbsp; Press the "DGT-"
button repeatedly to select a digital mode.&nbsp; To use Fldigi,
first start Quisk; then start Fldigi and change "Rig Control" to "Use
XML-RPC".&nbsp; Now changing the frequency in either program should
change the other.&nbsp; Now you need to connect the audio.&nbsp; Read
the file quisk_conf_defaults.py (as usual) and look for items starting
with "digital_" that are available for controlling digital modes.&nbsp;
Quisk has an additional audio input and output that you connect to
Fldigi (or other program).&nbsp; Quisk sends its audio to Fldigi to
decode signals, and Fldigi sends audio to Quisk for transmission.&nbsp;
See the <a href="docs.html">documentation</a> for more information.</p>

<h3 id="g0.0.12">Hamlib Control </h3>

Most digital mode decoders and logging programs use Hamlib to connect
to a rig.&nbsp; To connect Hamlib to Quisk, configure your client
program to use rig 2 and device localhost:4575.&nbsp; Rig 2 specifies a
TCP connection, and Quisk is listening on localhost port 4575.&nbsp; If
your program does not offer rig 2, please update your Hamlib files for
that program.&nbsp; If your program can not set the TCP port to
localhost:4575, then change the port Quisk uses by adding "hamlib_port
= 4532" to your config file.&nbsp;
See the <a href="docs.html">documentation</a> for more information.
<h3 id="g0.0.13">Sound Recording </h3>

There is a Record and Playback button in the third row.&nbsp; Push
Record to start recording radio sound.&nbsp; The maximum time to record
is set in the config file (default 15 seconds) and after this limit
older sound is discarded.&nbsp; That is, the most recent 15 seconds is
retained.&nbsp; Push Playback to play the sound.&nbsp; If you are
transmitting, the recorded sound is transmitted in place of mic
input.&nbsp; This sound is not speech processed, so it can be used to
give another station an accurate indication of how they sound.
<br>

<h3 id="g0.0.14">Sound Recording to a File </h3>

Quisk can record the speaker audio and the digital samples to WAV
files.&nbsp; Set the file names in the Config screen.&nbsp; Then Press
the "FileRec" button to begin recording, and release it to stop.&nbsp;
If you press it again, it starts a new recording to replace the
previous one.&nbsp; The speaker audio is stored as 16-bit monophonic
samples at the audio play rate.&nbsp; The samples are stored as two I/Q
IEEE floating point samples at the sample rate.&nbsp; Note that a WAV
file has a maximum size of 4.3 gigabytes, and that will limit the time
of the recording.
<br>

<h3 id="g0.0.15">Frequency Measurement </h3>

Quisk can measure and display the frequency of a continuous tone RF
signal.&nbsp; To use this feature, right click the S-meter window, and
select one of the Frequency items.&nbsp; The numbers are the averaging
times in seconds.&nbsp; Then find a signal of interest and put the
tuning line exactly on it.&nbsp; Quisk will search 500 Hertz up and
down from the tuning line and will display the frequency of the largest
signal.&nbsp; This feature works on AM signals
and continuous signals from oscillators, etc.&nbsp; It does not work
for SSB as there is no continuous signal.&nbsp; To calibrate your
hardware, measure the carrier from WWV
or other frequency standard, and change your clock rate until the
indicated frequency is correct.&nbsp; If you are using my QEX2010
hardware
or the HiQSDR, you can trim the resistors at the crystal to bring the
oscillator to exactly 122.88 megahertz.
<p>Have fun with Quisk.
